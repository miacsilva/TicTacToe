# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is my first C++ project

## How to play

It's a multiplayer game (2 player max)
Each player chooses their spot on the table to mark their symbol (X or O), one at a time. The way to choose the spot to mark is by telling in which row and which column of the board you want to pick (ex: "1 2" = row 1 column 2)
